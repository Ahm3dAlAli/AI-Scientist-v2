        "Related Work": "Existing research in reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction has primarily focused on optimizing task-specific rewards and safety in navigation tasks. Some works have explored adapting robot behavior based on social cues, such as linguistic style and humor. However, there is limited research on integrating a comprehensive range of social norms into RL frameworks for broader human-robot interaction scenarios. This proposal aims to fill this gap by explicitly targeting the integration of diverse social norms into RL models to enhance a variety of human-robot interactions.",
        "Abstract": "As AI systems increasingly interact with humans in everyday environments, ensuring that these systems can understand and adhere to a comprehensive range of social norms becomes imperative. Current reinforcement learning (RL) models primarily focus on optimizing task-specific rewards and often overlook the importance of social context. This research aims to integrate diverse social norms into RL frameworks to enhance human-robot interaction across various scenarios. By leveraging social cues and context, we propose a novel RL model that learns not only task efficiency but also social appropriateness. Our empirical studies will focus on collaborative tasks where robots assist humans in shared environments, such as homes or offices. We will evaluate our model's performance through user studies and objective metrics, including task completion time, user satisfaction, and compliance with social norms. This research has the potential to significantly improve the safety, acceptance, and effectiveness of AI systems in human-centric environments.",

        "Related Work": "Most existing research on self-supervised learning (SSL) focuses on improving accuracy or specific applications like image denoising, radar beamforming, or sensor calibration. For instance, S2-BNN explores SSL for binary neural networks but does not address calibration (Shen et al., 2021). Another study, R2S2, improves radar resolution using SSL but does not evaluate model calibration (Orr et al., 2021). This proposal uniquely targets the impact of SSL on neural network calibration, filling a gap in current research.",
        "Abstract": "Neural network calibration, the ability of a model to provide accurate estimates of its own uncertainty, is crucial for deploying AI systems in real-world applications where reliability and robustness are paramount. Traditional supervised learning approaches often lead to poorly calibrated models, particularly when dealing with noisy data or out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in various downstream tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data. However, the impact of SSL on model calibration has not been thoroughly investigated. In this research, we hypothesize that SSL techniques can significantly enhance the calibration of neural networks by providing more robust feature representations. We will conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the calibration performance of models trained with SSL on multiple benchmark datasets, comparing them against traditional supervised learning models. Our experiments will include both in-distribution and OOD scenarios to assess the generalization and robustness of the models. We will use standard calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, along with visual tools like reliability diagrams, to quantify the improvements. Additionally, we will explore the effect of different SSL paradigms, such as contrastive learning, masked image modeling, and self-distillation, on calibration. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between SSL and model calibration, our research aims to offer actionable insights for improving the reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.",

This research proposes an adaptive curriculum learning framework for MTRL, where the sequence of tasks is dynamically adjusted based on the agent's performance. We hypothesize that such an adaptive approach will lead to better generalization across tasks, faster convergence, and improved robustness against task interference.
